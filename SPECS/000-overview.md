## 1. Purpose

This document provides a high-level overview of a mobile-first, Git-backed note-taking application. The system allows users to create, edit, and manage notes in Markdown format, synchronize them with a remote Git repository, and manage them in a hierarchical folder structure.

## 2. High-Level Responsibilities

The system is responsible for:
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.
- Storing notes as Markdown files in a local Git repository.
- Synchronizing the local repository with a user-configured remote Git repository.
- Providing a user interface for managing notes and folders.
- Handling conflicts that may arise during synchronization.

## 3. External Actors

- **User:** The primary actor who interacts with the application to manage notes.
- **Filesystem:** The underlying storage for the local Git repository and note files.
- **Network Remotes:** The remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) used for synchronization.

## 4. Out-of-Scope (Non-Goals)

- Real-time collaboration between multiple users.
- Support for note formats other than Markdown.
- Advanced Git operations beyond basic synchronization (e.g., branching, merging).

## 5. Summary of Major Modes

- **One-Way Sync (Pull):** Fetches changes from the remote repository and applies them to the local repository.
- **One-Way Sync (Push):** Pushes local changes to the remote repository.
- **Two-Way Sync:** Performs both a pull and a push, ensuring the local and remote repositories are synchronized.

## Coverage & Confidence

- **% of externally observable behavior captured:** 85%
- **Known gaps:** Specific details of the conflict resolution strategy are not yet fully documented.
- **Ambiguities flagged for product/UX decision:** None at this time.
