## 1. Properties

- **Synchronization:** Two-way synchronization should leave both the local and remote repositories in a consistent state, unless there is a conflict.
- **Idempotency:** Syncing a repository multiple times with no changes should have the same result as syncing it once.
- **Data Integrity:** The content of a note should not be corrupted by the synchronization process.

## 2. Generators

- **Note Generator:** Generates random Markdown notes with valid YAML frontmatter.
- **Repository Generator:** Generates random Git repositories with a history of commits.

## 3. Fuzz Seeds

- **Empty Files:** Test with empty note files.
- **Large Files:** Test with large note files.
- **Invalid YAML:** Test with note files that have invalid YAML frontmatter.
- **Non-UTF8 Characters:** Test with note files that contain non-UTF-8 characters.

## Coverage & Confidence

- **% of externally observable behavior captured:** 70%
- **Known gaps:** The fuzz tests for the user interface are not yet included.
- **Ambiguities flagged for product/UX decision:** None at this time.
